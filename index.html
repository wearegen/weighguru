It&#39;s compatible with Apple Inc.&#39;s  Health and wellness  application, Fitbit, and Google&#39;s Android  as well as iOS  systems. It  can  videotaping  several body metrics, including body fat,  muscular tissue mass, water weight, bone density,  as well as BMI. It  makes use of high-precision sensors to track your  dimensions.<br />
<br />
When you first step on the scale, the  application will  inform you to align your feet on the  steel strips. This ensures the device  reaches your bare feet.  See to it you  eliminate your socks or pantyhose before stepping on the scale.
